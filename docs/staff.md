# Staff
The process of adding and removing staff members involves making modifications to the hubblehomes.xlsx file.  The hubblehomes.xlsx file is located 
in the hubblehomes data folder. The hubblehomes.xlsx file contains a sheet called helix-staff that needs to be updated with the staff member 
details.  

## Creating a New Staff Member
There's two different roles that a staff member can belong to, either `Sales` or `Design`.  It is important to know the distinction between the two
roles as the website will filter on this role, to list the staff members on the website on the appropriate pages. 

To create a new staff member, update the helix-staff sheet with the following information:   

* name - the name of the staff member.
* email - the email of the staff member.
* role - the role of the staff member.
* title - the title of the staff member.
* phone - the phone number of the staff member.
* office location 1 - the location where the staff member works.
* office location 2 - the second location where the staff member works.
* office location 3 - the third location where the staff member works.
* office location 4 - the fourth location where the staff member works.
* office location 5 - the fifth location where the staff member works.
* headshot - the url of the staff member's headshot (see next step).

### Staff Member Headshot
The staff member headshot is used to display the staff member on the website. The staff members' headshot should be size to 400x400 pixels for
best rendering. The staff member headshot should be added to the staff image folder located in hubblehomes > images > specialists. 
Once the image has been uploaded to the specialists folder, select the image and click preview and then publish the image. 
Once the image has been published, copy the url path that the publish operation generated and update the hubblehomes.xlsx helix-staff sheet with the 
new staff member's headshot path.

## Next Steps
Once changes have been made and saved to the hubblehomes.xlsx file, the next step is to preview/publish the changes to the website.  The website will
automatically update with the new staff member information once the changes have been published.
