# Cities
The process of creating a new city is a multi-step process that involves creating a folder and a Word document that defines the city.      

## Creating a New City

### Authoring a Word Document
To create a new city, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the folder hubblehomes > new-homes > idaho > boise-metro.  
2. Create a new folder with the name of the city.
3. Copy an existing city word document and rename it to the name of the city.
4. Open the Word document and update the content to reflect the new city.
5. Preview the Word document to ensure that the content is correct.
6. Copy the url path that the preview generated and keep it around for the next step.

### Modify the hubblehomes.xlsx File
After the city folder and word document have been created, the hubblehomes.xlsx file must be updated to reflect the new city.  
The hubblehomes.xlsx file is located in the hubblehomes data folder. The hubblehomes.xlsx file contains a sheet called helix-cities that 
needs to be updated with the new city details.  Update the helix-cities sheet with the following information:
* path
* name
* state

## Next Steps
After the city has been created, the next step is to create communities in the city.  See the [communities](./communities.md) documentation for 
more information on creating communities.
