# Corporation Spreadsheet
The corporation spreadsheet is a key component of the Hubble Homes XML feed.  The data in this spreadsheet 
should not need to be updated frequently, but when it does, it's important to understand that this data
is not used directly by the website, but by the generation of the XML feed that is published to
third-party websites.

## Next Steps
Once the corporation spreadsheet has been updated, preview and publish the changes such that the XML feed can be generated.
