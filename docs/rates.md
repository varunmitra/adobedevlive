# Rates
The hubblehomes.xlsx file contains a sheet called helix-rates that needs to be updated with the new rate details.  Update the helix-rates sheet 
with the following information:

* rate
* percent
* term

The values from the rates sheet are used in the calculations of the monthly payment for a home.  The rate is the interest rate, the percent is the
percentage of the rate, and the term is the term of the loan. 

## Next Steps
After the rates have been updated, you can preview/publish the rates to the website, then view the rates on the website to ensure that the rates
are displaying correctly.
