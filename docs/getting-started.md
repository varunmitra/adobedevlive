# Hubble Homes Authoring - Getting Started Guide
Welcome to Adobe Experience Manager's Hubble Homes authoring guide! We're excited to have you on board. This guide 
will help you get started with Hubble Homes and walk you through the process of setting up communities, models, 
inventory homes, staff, and home plans. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Hubble Homes authoring guide, you will need to have a basic understanding of how the data
is structured for Hubble Homes. The data is structured in a way that allows you to create cities, communities, models,
inventory homes, staff, and home plans. Each of these items are related to each other in a way that allows you to create
a hierarchy of data that can be used to create the Hubble Homes website. The website is built from a combination of
Word documents and xls files that are stored in a Sharepoint folder structure. A deeper dive into the Sharepoint folder
structure is provided in the [sharepoint.md](./sharepoint.md) file.

## Authoring Process
Having a strong understanding of the Sharepoint setup is key to understanding the authoring process. Once you have a good understanding
of the Sharepoint setup, you can begin to create cities, communities, models, inventory homes, staff, and home plans.  

Each section of the authoring process is broken down into separate documents that provide a detailed explanation of how to create each section.
The following documents provide a detailed explanation of how to create each of the different sections:

* [Cities](./cities.md)
* [Communities](./communities.md)
* [Models](./models.md)
* [Inventory Homes](./inventory-homes.md)
* [Home Plans](./home-plans.md)
* [Staff](./staff.md)
